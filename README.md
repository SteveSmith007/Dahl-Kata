# Dahl-Kata
Roald Dahl kata for AO.com


Hello,

Here is my worked through solution for the Dahl Kata.

It is written in C# using the .Net 4.7.2 Framework to help ensure compatibility.

To complete this Kata I used a TDD approach with no pre-conception of what the final solution would look like or what design patterns could be employed if any. I started with the the most basic requirements, wrote a test for that then wrote code to make that test pass before moving on to writing a test for the next requirement.

I have used main-line development to reflect the fact that there was only myself working on the code and I had a rapid commit cycle. However, I have at one point demostrated how I branched the code, developed a change and then merged it back into the master branch to show I know how to do that and am comfortable with it.

To download the code, simply click on the 'Clone or donload' button and choose which option you would like. You can Open in Desktop, Open in Visual Studio or probably most affective is to Download Zip file. You can then extract the solution to your desired location. Then, from within your IDE (Visual Studio or VS Code for example), load the GuildedRose.sln from within the GuildedRose folder.

Finally, build and run all tests.

There is a single, final test within the MainScenarioTest.cs file in the UnitTests project which tests the input and output scenario described in the problem breif.

Please Note:  In the later stages I found myself getting carried away a bit and started working on refactoring which added unnecessary complication.  Unfortunately I had some difficulty reverting my check-ins on git hub but eventually got it bak to a state I was happy with.

I hope you find the information contained here sufficient for you to assess my work. If you require anything further or need clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Regards,

Stephen
